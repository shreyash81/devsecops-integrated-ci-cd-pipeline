# 🎮 Jenkins DevSecOps Tic Tac Toe Automation

![Tic Tac Toe Screenshot](screenshot-link-here)

This project demonstrates **end-to-end DevSecOps automation** for a Tic Tac Toe game using **Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, and Argo CD**.  
The pipeline handles **build, test, containerization, security scanning, and automated deployment** to Kubernetes.

## 🛠 Features

- Fully functional **Tic Tac Toe game** with **X, O, and Draw** tracking  
- **Game history** with timestamps and highlights winning combinations  
- **Responsive design** for all devices  
- **Jenkins pipeline** automates: build → test → Docker image → deploy  
- **Security integration** with **Trivy, Snyk, and SonarQube**  
- Deployment on **Kubernetes cluster** using **Helm & Argo CD**  
- Health checks and HPA for **production-ready scalability**

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React (icons)  
- **CI/CD & DevSecOps:** Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Argo CD  
- **Security & Quality:** Trivy, Snyk, SonarQube

## 🚀 Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline

1. **Code push** triggers Jenkins pipeline  
2. **Static code analysis** with SonarQube  
3. **Security scans** with Trivy and Snyk  
4. **Docker image** built and pushed to registry  
5. **Kubernetes deployment** automated via Helm & Argo CD  
6. **HPA, health checks**, and monitoring ensure **reliable production-grade uptime**
